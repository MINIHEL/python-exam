#### **Question 1: Easy (Using If, List, and Len)**
**Task:**  
Write a Python program that checks whether a given list of numbers contains more than 5 elements. If it does, print "List has more than 5 elements", otherwise print "List has 5 or fewer elements".

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Expected output: List has more than 5 elements

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Expected output: List has 5 or fewer elements
```
