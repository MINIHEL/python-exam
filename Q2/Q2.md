#### **Question 2: Medium (Using For, Dictionary, and Split)**
**Task:**  
Write a Python function that takes a string of words and counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary. Ignore case and punctuation. Return the dictionary containing words as keys and their frequencies as values.

**Example:**
```python
text = "Hello world! Hello everyone."
# Expected output: {'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'everyone': 1}
```

*Hints:*
- Use `.split()` to separate the words.
- Use `.lower()` to handle case sensitivity.
- Remove punctuation using `.strip()`.
