#### **Question 3: Hard (Using While, List, Flag, Min, and Max)**
**Task:**  
Write a Python program that continuously accepts numbers from the user until they enter 'stop'. Then, the program should print the smallest and largest numbers entered. If no numbers were entered, print a message indicating that.

**Example:**
```python
# User inputs: 5, 2, 9, stop
# Expected output:
# Smallest number: 2
# Largest number: 9

# User inputs: stop
# Expected output:
# No numbers were entered.
```

*Hints:*
- Use a `while` loop to keep asking for input.
- Use a flag variable to check if any numbers were entered.
- Convert user input to numbers using `int()`.
- Use `min()` and `max()` to find the smallest and largest numbers.
