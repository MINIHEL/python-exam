#### **Bonus Question: (Using List, Dictionary, For, Append, Sort, Max, and Len)**
**Task:**  
Write a Python program that takes a list of student names and their corresponding test scores, then finds the student with the highest score and prints their name along with their score. The program should also print the average score of all students.

The list will be provided as two separate lists: one for student names and one for their corresponding scores. Make sure to handle cases where there are no students.

**Example:**
```python
# Given input:
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
scores = [85, 92, 78, 90]

# Expected output:
# Student with the highest score: Bob, Score: 92
# Average score: 86.25

# If the input lists are empty:
students = []
scores = []

# Expected output:
# No students or scores provided.
```

*Hints:*
- Use the `zip()` function to combine the `students` and `scores` lists.
- Use a dictionary to map student names to their scores.
- Use the `max()` function with a key argument to find the student with the highest score.
- Use the `len()` function to calculate the number of students for the average score.
- Be sure to handle cases where the input lists are empty.
